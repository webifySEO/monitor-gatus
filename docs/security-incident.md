# Security Alert Resolution - Exposed Slack Webhooks

## What Happened

Slack webhook URLs were accidentally committed to the GitHub repository in the `.env` file. These URLs contain sensitive tokens that allow posting messages to your Slack workspace.

## Webhooks That Were Exposed

1. **CLIENT1_SLACK** (Sloane's Bangkok): `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`
2. **CLIENT_ESSEXBANNERS_SLACK**: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`

## Actions Taken

‚úÖ **Immediate Security Fixes**:
- Removed `.env` file from Git tracking
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure  
- Created `.env.template` with placeholder values
- Updated README with security guidelines
- Replaced exposed URLs with placeholders in local `.env`

## Required Actions - TO DO

‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual Steps Required**:

1. **Get New Slack Webhooks** (URGENT):
   - Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps/A08GH8PFUDD/install-on-team
   - Or create new incoming webhooks at: https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Generate fresh webhook URLs to replace the compromised ones

2. **Update Local Environment**:
   ```powershell
   # Edit your local .env file
   notepad .env
   
   # Replace placeholder URLs with new webhook URLs:
   CLIENT1_SLACK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/NEW/WEBHOOK/URL1
   CLIENT_ESSEXBANNERS_SLACK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/NEW/WEBHOOK/URL2
   ```

3. **Test Alerts**:
   ```powershell
   # Deploy and test monitoring alerts
   .\scripts\deploy.ps1
   # Check that Slack notifications work
   ```

4. **Update Server Environment**:
   - SSH into your monitoring server
   - Update the `.env` file on the server with new webhook URLs
   - Restart the Gatus service

## Prevention

- ‚úÖ `.env` is now in `.gitignore`
